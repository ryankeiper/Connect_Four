#### Tic Tac Toe in JavaScript

## User Stories

### Mechanics

* As a user, I want to see a Tic Tac Toe board when the page loads, so that I can play TicTacToe with a friend.
* As a user, I want to click a Restart button to restart an ongoing game, so that I can start over if I make a bad move.
* As a user, I want to click a square to put my symbol in the square, so I can make a move in the game.
* As a user, I should not be able to make a move in a square that has already been filled, so nobody can overwrite existing moves.

### Game Logic

* As a user, I want to see whose turn it is, so my friend and I are not confused about who should play.
* As a user, I want to the game to stop when a result is reached, so that I know that the game is over.
* As a user, I want the winner to be displayed when the game ends, so that I know who won.
* As a user, I want a draw message to be displayed when the game ends in a draw, so I know the result of the game.

### UI

* As a user, I want clickable squares to glow when I hover over them, so I know where I can make moves before I click.
